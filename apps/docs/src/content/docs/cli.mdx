## FAQ

### Why use a CLI instead of an npm package?

The CLI approach gives you full control over the components. You can modify them as needed, and you don't have to worry about version conflicts or breaking changes.

### Can I use this in my existing project?

Yes! The CLI is designed to work with existing projects. Just run `npx @sickui/cli init` to get started.

### What happens when I run init?

Running `init` will:

1. Create a `components.json` file in your project root
2. Create a `lib/utils.ts` file with the `cn` helper function
3. Install the required dependencies
4. Set up your `tailwind.config.js` file

### Can I customize the components after adding them?

Absolutely! That's the whole point. The components are copied to your project, so you can modify them however you like.
