# Getting Started

Get started with SickUI in your React project.

## What is SickUI?

SickUI is a collection of copy-and-paste components built with **Radix UI** and **Tailwind CSS**. 

Unlike traditional component libraries, SickUI components are designed to be copied directly into your project. This gives you:

- **Full control** over the code
- **No package dependencies** to manage
- **Easy customization** without fighting against library constraints
- **Better performance** with tree-shaking

## Philosophy

- **Copy, paste, own** - The components are yours to modify
- **Accessible by default** - Built on Radix UI primitives
- **Customizable** - Easy to adapt to your design system
- **Developer friendly** - TypeScript-first with great DX

## Tech Stack

SickUI is built on top of:

- **React 18+** - Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety and excellent IntelliSense
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Radix UI** - Unstyled, accessible components
- **Class Variance Authority** - For component variants
- **Tailwind Merge** - For conditional classes

## Requirements

- React 18 or later
- TypeScript (recommended)
- Tailwind CSS 3.0 or later

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is with our CLI:

```bash
npx @sickui/cli init
```

This will:

1. Create a `components.json` configuration file
2. Set up your `lib/utils.ts` file
3. Install required dependencies
4. Configure your `tailwind.config.js`

Then add your first component:

```bash
npx @sickui/cli add button
```

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to set things up manually, follow the [installation guide](/docs/installation).

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
your-project/
├── components/
│   └── ui/
│       └── button.tsx
├── lib/
│   └── utils.ts
├── components.json
└── tailwind.config.js
```

## Next Steps

1. [Install SickUI](/docs/installation) in your project
2. Browse the [components](/docs/components) and copy what you need
3. Customize the components to match your design system
